## Overview

The success of large pretrained Transformers is closely tied to tokenizers, which convert raw input into discrete symbols. **GraphTokenizer** extends this paradigm to graph-structured data by introducing a general **graph tokenization** framework. It converts arbitrary labeled graphs into discrete token sequences, enabling standard off-the-shelf Transformer models (e.g., BERT, GTE) to be applied directly to graph data **without any architectural modifications**.

The framework combines **reversible graph serialization** with **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**, the de facto standard tokenizer in large language models. To better capture structural information, the serialization process is guided by **global statistics of graph substructures**, ensuring that frequently occurring substructures appear as adjacent symbols in the resulting sequence — an ideal input for BPE to discover a meaningful vocabulary of structural graph tokens. The entire process is **reversible**: the original graph can be faithfully reconstructed from its token sequence.

**Framework overview.** **(A)** Substructure frequencies (labeled-edge patterns) are collected from the training graphs. **(B)** Structure-guided reversible serialization via frequency-guided Eulerian circuit — at each node, the next edge is selected according to the frequency priority (e.g., at the red C node, the C–C pattern has the highest frequency, so that edge is traversed first). **(C)** A BPE vocabulary is trained on the serialized corpus; BPE iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent symbol pairs into new tokens, compressing sequences to ~10% of their original length while preserving common substructures.

### Key Contributions

- **General Graph Tokenization Framework.** Combines reversible graph serialization with BPE to create a bidirectional interface between graphs and sequence models. By decoupling the encoding of graph structure from the model architecture, it enables standard off-the-shelf Transformers to process graph data without any architectural modifications.
- **Structure-Guided Serialization for BPE.** A deterministic serialization mechanism guided by global substructure statistics. It addresses the ordering ambiguity inherent in graphs (permutation invariance) and systematically arranges frequent substructures into adjacent symbol patterns — precisely the input that BPE's greedy merging strategy is designed to exploit.
- **State-of-the-Art on 14 Benchmarks.** Achieves SOTA results across diverse graph classification and regression benchmarks spanning molecular, biomedical, social, academic, and synthetic domains. Scaling from a compact BERT-small to a larger GTE backbone yields consistent gains, demonstrating that graph tokenization can leverage the proven scaling behavior of Transformers.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTokenizer.git
cd GraphTokenizer

# Install in development mode.
# The checked-in pyproject.toml declares the build dependency on pybind11,
# so a network-enabled pip can bootstrap the C++ extension build automatically.
pip install -e .

# Build the C++ BPE backend (optional but recommended for speed)
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Key dependencies: `torch`, `dgl`, `networkx`, `rdkit`, `transformers`, `pybind11`, `pandas`.

Notes:

- If you are installing in an offline environment, preinstall `pybind11` into the target environment before running `pip install -e .`.
- `pip install -e .` only installs the local package metadata/build requirements. Runtime libraries such as `torch`, `dgl`, `rdkit`, and `transformers` still need to exist in the environment you use for experiments.

## Quick Start

### 1. Data Preparation

Before running `prepare_data_new.py`, make sure the raw/preprocessed dataset files already exist under `data/<dataset>/`.

The loaders in `src/data/loader/` assume the following files are present:

```text
data/<dataset>/
├── data.pkl
├── train_index.json
├── val_index.json
└── test_index.json
```

For molecular datasets such as `qm9` and `zinc`, some loaders will also look for optional SMILES files such as `smiles_1_direct.txt`.

For a clean clone, `qm9test` should be treated as a smoke-test dataset derived from `qm9`, not as a checked-in example dataset. Build `qm9` first from its public source, then generate `qm9test` with `data/qm9test/create_qm9test_dataset.py`.

Serialize graphs and train a BPE tokenizer:

```bash
python prepare_data_new.py \
    --datasets qm9test \
    --methods feuler \
    --bpe_merges 2000
```

This script:

- loads `data/qm9test/data.pkl` together with the fixed split files
- serializes every graph with the selected method
- trains a BPE model on the serialized corpus
- builds the vocabulary used by downstream Transformer runs
- writes cached artifacts under `data/processed/<dataset>/...`

After this step, you should expect processed artifacts in locations similar to:

```text
data/processed/qm9test/
├── serialized_data/feuler/single/serialized_data.pickle
└── vocab/feuler/bpe/single/vocab.json
```

Refer to the following resources for detailed data preparation and execution instructions:

- [`scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md`](scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md) — dataset-by-dataset conversion notes
- [`src/data/README.md`](src/data/README.md) — data layer contract and expected directory layout

Pre-packaged datasets are available here:

- Google Drive bundle: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/10etZF9OnV569_Fp7tpdMUVEH9eZECKdW/view?usp=sharing>

The repository also keeps raw-to-unified conversion scripts under dataset folders and [`scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md`](scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md). Those scripts are not only for rebuilding the released datasets; they are also intended as concrete references when integrating a new dataset into the same directory contract.

Current audited status:

- `qm9test` is the only dataset that has been fully verified through `prepare_data_new.py -> run_pretrain.py -> run_finetune.py`
- `mnist` and `mnist_raw` currently pass loader-level checks only; `prepare_data_new.py` must be executed before training
- `code2` is blocked in the checked-in repository state because `data/code2/data.pkl` is missing
- The complete audited status table is maintained in [`scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md`](scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md)

**Important Notes:**

- `prepare_data_new.py` uses plural CLI arguments (`--datasets`, `--methods`), while `run_pretrain.py` and `run_finetune.py` use singular ones (`--dataset`, `--method`)
- If preparing data with `--multiple_samples K`, the training scripts must be launched with matching `serialization.multiple_sampling.enabled=true` and `serialization.multiple_sampling.num_realizations=K`; otherwise, they will read from `single/` instead of `multi_K/`
- The checked-in default config currently sets `encoder.type: gte`, so runs will use the GTE encoder unless explicitly switched to `bert`

### 2. Pre-training

Pre-train a Transformer encoder with Masked Language Modeling (MLM):

```bash
python run_pretrain.py \
    --dataset qm9test \
    --method feuler \
    --experiment_group my_experiment \
    --epochs 100 \
    --batch_size 256
```

**Important Notes:**

- `--dataset` and `--method` are required
- The script reads the processed artifacts produced by `prepare_data_new.py`
- The default config uses the paths in `config/default_config.yml`, where `data_dir` resolves to `data/`
- A verified one-epoch `qm9test` smoke test with `multi_3` serialization is documented in [`scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md`](scripts/dataset_conversion/README.md)

### 3. Fine-tuning

Fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream graph prediction tasks:

```bash
python run_finetune.py \
    --dataset qm9test \
    --method feuler \
    --experiment_group my_experiment \
    --target_property homo \
    --epochs 200 \
    --batch_size 64
```

For regression datasets such as `qm9`, set `--target_property` explicitly. For classification datasets such as `mutagenicity` or `molhiv`, the loader metadata is usually sufficient and no regression target is needed.

**Fine-tuning Notes:**

- `run_finetune.py` currently requires CUDA (`torch.cuda.is_available()` is asserted at startup)
- For smoke tests, `--pretrained_dir` should point directly to `model/<group>/<exp_name>/run_0/best`
- The pre-trained checkpoint directory must contain both `config.bin` and `pytorch_model.bin`

### 4. Batch Experiments

Run experiments across multiple datasets, serialization methods, and GPUs in parallel:

```bash
python batch_pretrain_simple.py \
    --datasets qm9,zinc,mutagenicity \
    --methods feuler,eulerian,cpp \
    --bpe_scenarios all,raw \
    --gpus 0,1

python batch_finetune_simple.py \
    --datasets qm9,zinc,mutagenicity \
    --methods feuler,eulerian,cpp \
    --bpe_scenarios all,raw \
    --gpus 0,1
```

## Reproducing Paper Experiments

Scripts for all paper experiments are in the `final/` directory:

- **Main experiments** — `final/exp1_main/run/`: pre-training and fine-tuning commands for all 14 datasets
- **Efficiency analysis** — `final/exp1_speed/`: serialization speed, token length stats, training throughput
- **Multi-sampling comparison** — `final/exp2_mult_seralize_comp/`: effect of multiple serialization samples
- **BPE vocabulary visualization** — `final/exp4_bpe_vocab_visual/`: codebook inspection and visualization

For the maintained Optuna-based hyperparameter search workflow, see:

- [`hyperopt/README.md`](hyperopt/README.md)

## Dataset Preparation Checklist

Use the following checklist to verify that a dataset is runnable end-to-end:

1. Put the dataset under `data/<dataset>/`
2. Ensure `data.pkl`, `train_index.json`, `val_index.json`, and `test_index.json` all exist
3. Confirm the dataset name is registered in `src/data/unified_data_factory.py`
4. Run:

```bash
python prepare_data_new.py --datasets <dataset> --methods feuler
```

5. Verify that `data/processed/<dataset>/serialized_data/...` and `data/processed/<dataset>/vocab/...` were created
6. If you prepared with multiple sampling, also verify whether the artifacts were written to `single/` or `multi_<K>/`
7. Run a small pre-training smoke test:

```bash
python run_pretrain.py --dataset <dataset> --method feuler --epochs 1 --batch_size 8
```

8. Run a small fine-tuning smoke test:

```bash
python run_finetune.py --dataset <dataset> --method feuler --epochs 1 --batch_size 8
```

Fine-tuning also requires a CUDA-capable device and a valid pre-trained checkpoint.
